Rules for writting concurrent boolean program:
=================================================================

- global variable 'super_atomic' and 'atomic' must be declared first following the order
- init always the first function
- In init function, super_atomic and atomic must be set to F
- the first statement of every thread must be  'atomic := F;'
- always use assume(T) at the end of each thread
